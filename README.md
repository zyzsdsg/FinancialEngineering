In this repository, I demonstrate how we can use code to implement mathematical concepts typically taught at university.

[main.ipynb](./Python/main.ipynb): This notebook presents a simple example of pricing a European call option. The main purpose is to compare the runtime performance between C++ and Python. 

Although this is a basic example, it clearly shows that the C++-based class runs about 10 times faster than its Python counterpart.
